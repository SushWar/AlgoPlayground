        Problem Statement
            In a lively car showroom, an array of cars awaits, each with its distinctive features. Picture yourself mixing and matching these cars in unique combinations to create dream blends which has a fscore equal to the XOR value of the combination. 

            Your mission: compute the blend score, which is the XOR of the fscore values for all these dreamy combinations.  (https://unstop.com/code/challange-asesment/261990?moduleId=406)

            Now, it's time to reveal the grand total!

        Input Format
            The first line of input consists of the integer n â€“ representing the number of cars in the showroom.

            The second line consists of n integers - representing the features of the car. 

        Output Format
            Print the sum of fscore obtained.
